Evaluating Angular framework for PWA dev.  Findings so far:

- Creating new webap and run on dev server takes two commands.  
- Build and deploy to Netlify with minor mods and custom domain, takes minutes.
- Scaleable, complex, feature-rich, widely-adopted web app dev framework with a huge dev community and substantial tooling.
- So far seems to be a more complex web dev framework than Next.js. 
  
Currently looking at Angular Material UI component lib.
