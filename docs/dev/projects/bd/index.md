## Purpose

Collaborative Development

## Tech Stack

Full-Stack Next.js Web App

## Status

In development.

Prototype: [www.browndomain.com](https://www.browndomain.com)

Findings so far:

- Next.js site up and running on dev server with two commands.  
- Next.js and React have totes excellent documentation.  
- Customization and deploy to Vercel with custom domain, is extrememly rapid and painless.  LAMP this is not.
- Feature-rich, high-performance, widely-adopted web app dev framework with a huge dev community and ample tooling.
- Appears to have more built-in functionality and simpler to implement than Angular.

Currently looking to use it as an SSG for large static assets, with a dynamic IF.
