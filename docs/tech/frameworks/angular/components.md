# Adding Angular Content

Angular apps are single page.  When different content is requested, the browser only renders the part of the page that is required.  This can reduce traffic and increase responsiveness.

## Adding Components

One way to add content is to add a component.  

To add a new component:

```bash
ng generate component new # Angular is a gen ng
CREATE src/app/two/two.component.css (0 bytes)
CREATE src/app/two/two.component.html (18 bytes)
CREATE src/app/two/two.component.spec.ts (571 bytes)
CREATE src/app/two/two.component.ts (222 bytes)
```

A component has its own logic and inner-connent, and, optionally style, and unit tests.
