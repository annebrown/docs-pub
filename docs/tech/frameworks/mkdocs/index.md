## Description

{{ description }}

MkDocs, with its rich set of [add-ons](../mkdocs/add-ons/index.md), provides a feature-rich, well-documented framework for deploying documention-based static sites.  

After evaluating alternatives, such as Hugo, Jeykll, Gatsby, and Next.js, MkDocs was faster to learn and deploy.  Other SSGs may have more features, but are either underdocumented or accessing their documentation was like drinking water from a firehose.  MkDocs's specific focus and design make it my choice for a highly customizable, rapid, efficient and painless SSG.
