## Description

My Notes on MkDocs, {{ description }}

MkDocs, with its rich set of [add-ons](../mkdocs/add-ons/index.md), provides a feature-rich, well-documented framework for deploying documention-based static sites.  

After evaluating alternatives, such as Hugo, Jeykll, Gatsby, and Next.js, MkDocs was faster to learn and deploy.  Other SSGs may have more features, but were either underdocumented or reviewing their documentation was like drinking water from a firehose.  MkDocs's specific focus and design make it my choice for a highly customizable, rapid, efficient and painless SSG.

!!! warning

    [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/ "Official Site") is an essential add-on framework for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/ "Official Site"), however, to use some of its features (like breadcrumbs), they are asking for $15/mo sponsorship payment, for individual, non-commercial use. These fees are waived for contributors.
