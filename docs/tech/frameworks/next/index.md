## Description

My notes on Next.js, {{ description }}

>[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/ "Official Site") has lots of great documentation, however, is in a continual state of evolution, resulting in non-breaking changes.  Where docs don't match new newly created apps, refer to the [Official Docs](https://nextjs.org)
